<h1>phenomenal woman by maya angelou</h1>
<p>I walk into a room
Just as cool as you please,   
and to a man,</p>
<p>the fellows stand or
fall down on their knees. </p>

<p>Then they swarm around me,
A hive of honey bees.   
I say, </p>

<p>It’s the fire in my eyes,   
and the flash of my teeth, </p>  

<p>The swing in my waist,   
and the joy in my feet. </p>  

<p>I’m a woman, </p>

<p>Phenomenally.</p>
