Description:
I edited the original webpage displaying “Phenomenal Woman” by Maya Angelou to make it more accessible and readable. 
In the accessible version, I used a lighter background with dark text to improve contrast, switched to clean sans-serif fonts like Helvetica Neue and Arial for easier screen reading, and increased the font size for better visibility.
I also added a clear structure by introducing <main>, <section>, and proper heading levels.
The image now includes descriptive alt text, helping visually impaired users understand what is displayed. 
Line spacing was increased to make text blocks more comfortable to read. 
Overall, I aimed to make the design more inclusive and easier to navigate.

Reflection: Accessibility and Readability Changes
- Improved colour contrast (black text on white background) enhances legibility.
- Added semantic HTML tags (<main>, <section>, <h2>) to support screen readers.
- Increased font size and line spacing for better readability.
- Used accessible fonts (sans-serif, clean, consistent).
- Included alt text to describe the image for non-visual users.
- Maintained a clear hierarchy between headings and paragraphs.
- Reduced visual strain and improved overall reading comfort.
- Change the colour of Maya Angelou's title from brown to black for better readability
- Created a page structure that is easier for both people and assistive technologies to interpret.
