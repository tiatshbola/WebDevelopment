  <p>
    My website is going to be a simple art portfolio based on a basic brutalist website. I  want
    to implement complexity in the UI while still maintaining the simplicity of an artist
    portfolio.

      “My website is a shifting house next to a river of knowledge — what could yours be?”
    </a>,
    I want this website to prioritise clarity and individuality, positioning myself as a
    premium creative.
  </p>

  <p>
    With premium brands, less is often more. I wanted to reflect this philosophy in my work
    by focusing on restraint, intention, and clarity rather than excess.
